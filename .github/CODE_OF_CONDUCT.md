# Code of Conduct

## Required Conduct

- Maintain technical precision in all discussions.
- Keep communication concise and fact-based.
- Focus on problem statements, not individuals.
- Respect review boundaries: no bypassing, no pressuring for approvals.
- Preserve project integrity: no knowingly breaking builds, tests, or interfaces.
- Disclose conflicts of interest affecting decisions.

## Prohibited Conduct

- Personal attacks, sarcasm targeting contributors, or hostility.
- Derailing technical threads with unrelated topics.
- Submitting intentionally low-quality work to offload effort onto reviewers.
- Withholding information that affects debugging or security.
- Introducing dependencies, services, or libraries without prior justification.
- Circumventing established branch or release rules.

## Collaboration Rules

- Treat review comments as required adjustments until resolved.
- Keep discussions in public project channels for traceability.
- Attribute all reused code, diagrams, or text.
- Use issue trackers for proposals, not ad-hoc requests in chats.

## Security and Confidentiality

- Do not publish sensitive credentials, API keys, or internal data.
- Report vulnerabilities privately to maintainers immediately.
- Avoid importing code of unclear licensing origin.

## Enforcement

- Violations lead to warning, removal of commit privileges, or project removal.
- Maintainers are responsible for interpreting and enforcing these rules.
- Decisions are final once maintainers close the discussion.
